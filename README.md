# PLUS-to-ISA-Adapter
Tandy 1000 EX / HX Plus to ISA Adapter for the OEM Memory Expansion

This PLUS-ISA/R Adapter allows you to add Half-height, Half-length Industry standard 8-Bit ISA cards to Tandy 1000 EX or HX Machines that have a Tandy PLUS-RAM memory expansion Board installed. You can install up to 2x ISA cards into an EX or HX machine (1x adapter per ISA card).

I made these so that folks can easily upgrade their classic Tandy computers with standard ISA expansion cards. This allows you to add boards like the Lo-tech Compact Flash IDE HDD controller, RS232 Serial Boards etc.
